# processor-extensions Specification

## Purpose

The processor-extensions capability is the typed extension-point system exposed by processor hosts (e.g. `Flezha.Processor.Overwatch`). Each host declares its extension points once in a module-level catalog; plugins are represented as a unified `%Flezha.Plugin{}` struct carrying a `subscriptions` list and attach to those extensions as data, and the engine dispatches each extension through `Flezha.Plugin.Extension.Table` — a per-host registry that holds subscriptions, pre-composed dispatch chains keyed by extension kind (`:fold`, `:transform`, `:fanout`, `:request`, `:timer`), an active-extensions bitset, and all subscriber lifecycle state (monitor refs, timer refs, restart bookkeeping, `PluginManager` registrations). The capability defines how plugins declare subscriptions, how the table compiles dispatch chains per extension kind, how the active-bitset fast path makes unused extensions zero-cost, how lifecycle (subscribe / unsubscribe / teardown / restart / handover) is handled uniformly, and what guarantees hold across the extension points a host publishes. Adding a new extension point becomes a catalog entry plus a single `Extension.run/3` call at the dispatch site.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Extension-point catalog

The system SHALL declare every extension point exposed by a host module (e.g. `Flezha.Processor.Overwatch`) in a single module-level catalog. Each catalog entry MUST specify the extension name (atom), its dispatch kind (one of `:fold`, `:transform`, `:fanout`, `:request`, `:timer`), and its context-struct module. The catalog SHALL be the sole source of truth for which extension points exist on that host; no runtime registration of new extension names is permitted.

#### Scenario: Overwatch declares its catalog
- **WHEN** `Flezha.Processor.Overwatch` is compiled
- **THEN** the module SHALL declare an `@extensions` attribute containing at least these entries: `{:on_processor_init, :fold, Flezha.Plugin.Extension.Ctx.Init}`, `{:on_input, :transform, Flezha.Plugin.Extension.Ctx.IO}`, `{:on_output, :transform, Flezha.Plugin.Extension.Ctx.IO}`, `{:on_interval, :timer, Flezha.Plugin.Extension.Ctx.Tick}`, `{:on_message, :request, Flezha.Plugin.Extension.Ctx.Msg}`, `{:on_snapshot, :fanout, Flezha.Plugin.Extension.Ctx.Snapshot}`, `{:on_terminate, :fanout, Flezha.Plugin.Extension.Ctx.Terminate}`

#### Scenario: Subscribing to an undeclared extension fails
- **WHEN** a subscription attempts to attach to an extension name not present in the host's catalog
- **THEN** `Flezha.Plugin.Extension.Table.subscribe/3` MUST return `{:error, {:unknown_extension, name}}` and state MUST NOT be mutated

### Requirement: Unified plugin struct with subscriptions

The system SHALL represent a plugin as a single `%Flezha.Plugin{}` struct with fields `id` (string), `provider` (a module implementing the relevant extension callbacks), `opts` (a map of provider configuration), and `subscriptions` (a list of `{extension_name, subscription_opts}` tuples). A single `%Flezha.Plugin{}` MAY subscribe to multiple extension points.

#### Scenario: Plugin subscribes to multiple extensions
- **WHEN** a plugin is constructed with `subscriptions: [{:on_input, [position: 0]}, {:on_interval, [interval_ms: 5_000]}, {:on_terminate, []}]` and enabled via `Extension.Table.subscribe/3`
- **THEN** the provider module's `on_input/2`, `on_interval/2`, and `on_terminate/2` callbacks MUST each be invoked on the corresponding dispatch event
- **AND** a single `unsubscribe/2` MUST remove all three subscriptions atomically

#### Scenario: Provider missing a subscribed callback
- **WHEN** a plugin subscribes to `{:on_input, _}` but its `provider` module does not export `on_input/2`
- **THEN** `Extension.Table.subscribe/3` MUST return `{:error, {:missing_callback, :on_input}}` and state MUST NOT be mutated

### Requirement: Fold-kind dispatch

The system SHALL dispatch `:fold`-kind extensions by invoking each subscriber's callback in position order, threading the accumulator returned by each call into the next. A callback MAY return `{:ok, ctx}` to continue the fold or `{:error, reason}` to halt the chain. A halt MUST return `{:error, reason}` from `Extension.run/3` without invoking further subscribers.

#### Scenario: Ordered fold with multiple subscribers
- **WHEN** three subscribers at positions 0, 1, 2 return `{:ok, ctx_a}`, `{:ok, ctx_b}`, `{:ok, ctx_c}` respectively
- **THEN** `Extension.run/3` MUST invoke them in order 0 → 1 → 2 passing each preceding result as the ctx input to the next, and MUST return `{:ok, ctx_c}`

#### Scenario: Fold halts on error
- **WHEN** a subscriber at position 1 returns `{:error, :db_down}` and a third subscriber exists at position 2
- **THEN** the position-2 subscriber MUST NOT be invoked and `Extension.run/3` MUST return `{:error, :db_down}`

### Requirement: Transform-kind dispatch

The system SHALL dispatch `:transform`-kind extensions by invoking each subscriber in position order. A callback returning `{:ok, ctx}` continues the chain; `{:skip, reason}` halts and returns `{:skip, reason}` from `Extension.run/3`; `{:error, reason}` logs the error and continues with the PRIOR ctx (preserving the existing IO-binding behaviour where errors do not corrupt the in-flight payload).

#### Scenario: Transform chain with skip
- **WHEN** a subscriber at position 1 returns `{:skip, :rate_limited}`
- **THEN** subsequent subscribers MUST NOT be invoked and `Extension.run/3` MUST return `{:skip, :rate_limited}`

#### Scenario: Transform chain tolerates subscriber errors
- **WHEN** a subscriber at position 1 returns `{:error, :backend_unavailable}` and another subscriber exists at position 2
- **THEN** the error MUST be logged at `:error` level, the position-2 subscriber MUST be invoked with the ctx as it was after position 0, and the final result MUST be that of position 2

### Requirement: Fanout-kind dispatch

The system SHALL dispatch `:fanout`-kind extensions by invoking every subscriber independently. Subscribers MUST NOT observe each other's return values. A subscriber that raises or returns an error MUST be logged and MUST NOT prevent other subscribers from running. `Extension.run/3` for `:fanout` extensions always returns `:ok`.

#### Scenario: Fanout runs every subscriber
- **WHEN** three subscribers are attached to a `:fanout` extension
- **THEN** all three subscribers MUST be invoked regardless of return values or raised exceptions, and `Extension.run/3` MUST return `:ok`

#### Scenario: Fanout subscriber raise is isolated
- **WHEN** one fanout subscriber raises an exception during its callback
- **THEN** the exception MUST be captured and logged, subsequent subscribers MUST still run, and `Extension.run/3` MUST return `:ok`

### Requirement: Request-kind dispatch with keyed uniqueness

The system SHALL dispatch `:request`-kind extensions by looking up exactly one subscriber by a request key supplied in the ctx. Multiple plugins MUST NOT be permitted to subscribe to the same `:request`-kind extension with the same key on the same host. The subscriber's callback MUST be invoked in a short-lived Task supervised by a host-owned supervisor so the host's mailbox is not blocked by the callback.

#### Scenario: Request routes to the keyed subscriber
- **WHEN** `Extension.run/3` is called for a `:request` extension with a ctx whose key matches a registered subscriber
- **THEN** that subscriber's callback MUST be invoked with the ctx inside a Task, and the reply MUST be sent via the ctx's reply mechanism

#### Scenario: Duplicate key subscription rejected
- **WHEN** a plugin attempts to subscribe to a `:request` extension with a key already in use by another plugin on the same host
- **THEN** `Extension.Table.subscribe/3` MUST return `{:error, {:key_conflict, extension_name, key}}` and the existing subscriber MUST remain registered unchanged

#### Scenario: Unknown request key
- **WHEN** `Extension.run/3` is called for a `:request` extension with a key not registered
- **THEN** the reply mechanism MUST deliver `{:error, {:unknown_key, extension_name, key}}` to the caller and the host MUST NOT crash

### Requirement: Timer-kind dispatch

The system SHALL dispatch `:timer`-kind extensions via scheduled invocations. When a plugin subscribes with `{:on_interval, [interval_ms: N]}`, the extension table SHALL schedule a timer that sends `{:extension_timer, extension_name, plugin_id}` to the host process every `N` milliseconds. The host SHALL forward these timer messages into `Extension.Table.fire_timer/3`, which invokes the subscriber and reschedules the next tick.

#### Scenario: Timer subscription schedules periodic invocation
- **WHEN** a plugin subscribes to `{:on_interval, [interval_ms: 1_000]}`
- **THEN** the subscriber's `on_interval/2` callback MUST be invoked approximately every 1_000 ms until the plugin is unsubscribed

#### Scenario: Unsubscribe cancels timer
- **WHEN** a plugin with an active `:on_interval` subscription is unsubscribed
- **THEN** all pending timer messages for that plugin MUST be cancelled and no further invocations MUST occur

### Requirement: Active-extensions fast path

The system SHALL maintain an `active_mask` integer in `Extension.Table` in which bit N is set if and only if extension at catalog index N has at least one subscriber. `Extension.run/3` MUST check this mask before invoking any dispatch logic; when the mask bit is clear the call MUST return the ctx unchanged (for `:fold` / `:transform`), `:ok` (for `:fanout`), or an empty-key outcome (for `:request`) without invoking user code or allocating list cells.

#### Scenario: Extension with no subscribers is zero-cost
- **WHEN** `Extension.run/3` is called for an extension with zero subscribers
- **THEN** no provider callback MUST be invoked and no subscriber-specific data structure MUST be traversed

#### Scenario: Bit flips on first and last subscriber
- **WHEN** the first subscriber is added to an extension, its mask bit MUST be set; when the last subscriber for that extension is removed, its mask bit MUST be cleared

### Requirement: Dispatch chains are pre-composed at subscribe time

For `:fold`, `:transform`, and `:fanout` extensions, the system SHALL build the dispatch function once when subscriptions change (on subscribe, unsubscribe, or reorder), and SHALL NOT traverse the subscriber list on each `Extension.run/3` call. The dispatch path MUST NOT allocate per-subscriber control-flow tuples (e.g. `{:cont, _}` / `{:halt, _}`) on each invocation.

#### Scenario: Chain rebuilt on subscribe
- **WHEN** a new subscriber is added to a `:fold` or `:transform` extension that already has subscribers
- **THEN** the pre-composed dispatch function for that extension MUST be rebuilt so subsequent `Extension.run/3` calls include the new subscriber in position order

#### Scenario: Dispatch path does not traverse subscriber list
- **WHEN** `Extension.run/3` is called with N subscribers attached (N ≥ 1)
- **THEN** the call MUST invoke the pre-composed dispatch function and MUST NOT call `Enum.reduce/3`, `Enum.reduce_while/3`, or any list-iteration primitive over the subscriber list

### Requirement: Subscriber lifecycle owned by Extension.Table

The system SHALL place all subscriber-owned runtime state — monitor refs for spawned subscriber pids, timer refs for `:timer` subscriptions, retry-backoff counters, and `PluginManager` registrations — inside `Flezha.Plugin.Extension.Table`. The host process SHALL forward `{:DOWN, ref, :process, pid, reason}`, `{:extension_timer, name, plugin_id}`, and `{:retry_plugin_restart, plugin_id}` messages into the table, which MUST resolve them to the owning subscriber and apply the extension-kind-appropriate policy.

#### Scenario: DOWN for subscriber-owned pid
- **WHEN** the host process receives `{:DOWN, ref, :process, pid, reason}` where `ref` belongs to a subscriber
- **THEN** `Extension.Table.handle_down/5` MUST resolve `ref` to the owning plugin, apply its restart policy, and return updated table state

#### Scenario: DOWN for unrelated pid
- **WHEN** the host process receives `{:DOWN, ref, :process, pid, reason}` where `ref` does not belong to any subscriber
- **THEN** `Extension.Table.handle_down/5` MUST return `:ignore` and state MUST NOT be mutated

#### Scenario: Teardown releases every resource
- **WHEN** `Extension.Table.teardown_all/1` is invoked
- **THEN** every subscriber-owned monitor MUST be demonitored, every timer ref MUST be cancelled, every subscriber-owned pid MUST be signalled to stop, and every `PluginManager` registration MUST be released

### Requirement: Subscription ordering for ordered kinds

The system SHALL honor a `position` option in subscription opts for `:fold` and `:transform` extensions. Subscribers MUST be invoked in ascending position order. When a new subscriber's position collides with an existing one, subsequent subscribers MUST be shifted upward and renumbered contiguously. `:fanout`, `:request`, and `:timer` kinds MUST reject `position` in subscription opts with `{:error, :position_not_applicable}`.

#### Scenario: Position-based insertion shifts followers
- **WHEN** three subscribers exist at positions 0, 1, 2 and a fourth is added with `position: 1`
- **THEN** the new subscriber occupies position 1, the previous position-1 subscriber is renumbered to 2, and the previous position-2 subscriber is renumbered to 3

#### Scenario: Position on fanout-kind rejected
- **WHEN** a plugin subscribes to a `:fanout` extension with `position: 0` in subscription opts
- **THEN** `Extension.Table.subscribe/3` MUST return `{:error, :position_not_applicable}`

### Requirement: Subscription preserved across processor handover

The system SHALL serialize the extension-table subscription list during `Flezha.Processor.Overwatch.prepare_handover_state/1` and SHALL rehydrate it on the destination node via `Extension.Table.rehydrate/2` during `alter_handover_state/2`. Runtime state that is not transportable (monitor refs, timer refs, subscriber-owned pids) MUST be re-established on the destination node during rehydration. After rehydration the dispatch behaviour MUST match the pre-migration state.

#### Scenario: Subscribed plugins survive migration
- **WHEN** a processor with subscribers on `:on_input` and `:on_message` is migrated to a new compute engine
- **THEN** after migration `Extension.run(:on_input, ctx)` MUST invoke the same set of subscribers as before migration, and `Extension.run(:on_message, ctx_with_key)` MUST route to the same handler

#### Scenario: Subscriber-owned pids are restarted on destination
- **WHEN** a subscriber with a monitored pid is migrated
- **THEN** the destination node MUST spawn a new process for that subscriber and establish a fresh monitor; the source node's pid and monitor ref MUST NOT be transported
